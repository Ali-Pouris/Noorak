# Noorak

Noorak (Little Light) is trapped in an underground world and must find his way out. You have to fly Noorak and pass through strange obstacles.

Noorak is a surreal game, a little hard, a little intellectual and a little challenging.
In this game, it is possible to customize the character and background, or you can play the game in black and white.
