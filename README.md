# Noorak

Noorak (Little Light) is trapped in an underground world and must find his way out. You have to fly Noorak and pass through strange obstacles.

Noorak is a surreal game, a little hard, a little intellectual and a little challenging.
In this game, it is possible to customize the character and background, or you can play the game in black and white.
This game has 13 stages and about 15 minutes or more gameplay. This game is in development and more levels will be added soon.
